Feature: Negative responses after making a get request by id

  Scenario Outline: Can't find a channel by id with invalid params
    Given I make a 'GET' request to '/channels/<Id>' endpoint
    When I execute the request to the endpoint
    Then I expect a '400' status code
    And the response body contains excluding 'timestamp':
    """
      {
        "status": 400,
        "error": "Bad Request",
        "exception": "org.springframework.web.method.annotation.MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException",
        "message": "Bad Request",
        "path": "/channels/<Id>"
      }
    """
    Examples:
    | Id  |
    | abc |
    | !@$ |
    | 510@ |
    | 510. |
    | 510.1 |
    | 510.a |
    | 0510.$ |
    | 0510.!@#$@!# |

    Scenario: Can't Find a channel with nonexistent id
      Given I make a 'GET' request to '/channels/9999999' endpoint
      When I execute the request to the endpoint
      Then I expect a '404' status code
