  Background: send a notification
    Given I make a 'POST' request to '/notifications' endpoint
    When I set the body as:
      """
      {
        "channelId": 8,
        "priority": "HIGH",
        "recipients": ["#general"],
        "subject": "test API",
        "content": "Hi there, The JCN team is making a demo about Notifier."
      }
      """

    Then I expect a '200' status code
    And I save the id
